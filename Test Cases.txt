Test Cases:

1. Input an address with a correct PIN code and verify that the program returns True.
2. Input an address with an incorrect PIN code and verify that the program returns False.
3. Input an address with a valid format but not found in the API database and verify that the program returns False.
4. Input an address with an invalid format and verify that the program handles it gracefully, possibly by returning False or raising an exception.
5. Input an address with special characters and verify that the program correctly extracts and compares the PIN code.
6. Input an address without a PIN code and verify that the program handles it gracefully, possibly by returning False or raising an exception
