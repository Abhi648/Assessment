Q1 - Address Validation
Problem
BestDelivery Courier Company faces issues with incorrect PIN codes on parcels, leading to delivery problems. A program is needed to validate addresses against PIN codes using the postalpincode.in API.

Solution
We'll write a program that takes a free-flowing address as input, extracts the PIN code, queries the API for the correct address, and compares the two. If they match, the address is considered correct; otherwise, it's incorrect.

Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Input an address.
3. The program will validate and provide the result.
